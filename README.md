PLEASE READ: The jupyter noteboooks in the scripts folder for analysis are labeled according to the approaches highlighted in the report. The Data Cleaning and EDA were done in R and is also available in the scripts folder. The data folder is empty and only used in our local machine.

The provided URL is used to access the data for this project. Note that there are 3 CSV's titled airlines, airports, and flights, however as mentioned in the report the "airlines" and "airports" csv's are simply additional lookup files, and the main file of interest is the "flights" csv.

The goal of this project was a classification problem to determine whether a flight would arrive at its destination airport on time (within 15 minutes of stated arrival time) or delayed (15 minutes past scheduled arrival time), and in doing so testing various statistical learning algorithms designed for classification.

We also implemented clustering to help reduce our feature set and improve predictive power of our supervised models.
